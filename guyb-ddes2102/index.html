<p class="subtitle">How did your role model manage to attain that position/career/level of practice? Is it possible to trace the structures, relations and outputs that allowed these role models to get where they are?</p>
<p>Ye was, like many creatives, thrust into the art and design world at a very young age. Their parents placed them into Chinese calligraphy classes, where she honed her skills as an artist. Later on in life, Ye would move to Silicon Valley, which shifted her practice into working with technology and coding. Ye’s formal education includes a Master of Landscape Architecture from Cornell University and a Bachelor of Architecture from ZJUT, and she has worked extensively individually as well as at a number of design practices internationally.</p>
<p>Ye’s practice has evolved drastically over time. She began with calligraphy, and now their most recent projects are augmented reality-powered sculptures. In between, they have undertaken both employed and self-directed work to design places, books, apps and brands. As of this year, Ye works as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts and Parsons School of Design, is a  Civic Media Fellow at USC Annenberg Innovation Lab and leads p5.js, a creative coding tool.</p>
<p>This practice is extremely varied. Despite this, at the centre of all of Ye’s work, both professional and personal, is a desire to explore their own values. Ye’s journey proves that a career in the design field is a complex map that spans different places and even mediums, but your personal philosophies are an effective compass through which to maintain the course.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What type of design practice do they belong to or have they established? eg. Commercial, entrepreneurial, socially engaged. Examine how this type of practice impacts the work they produce.</p>
<p>Ye’s career has spanned both commercial and socially-engaged practice. Their commercial work was completed through her employment in design collectives as well as their current job as an educator. In contrast, Ye has designed many socially-engaged projects that span issues of gender, politics and personhood in the digital age.</p>
<p>Ye’s practical design work includes explorations of:
<ul>
	<li>Experience design</li>
	<ul><li>Architecture</li>
	<li>Placemaking</li></ul>
	<li>Interaction design</li>
	<ul><li>Apps</li>
	<li>UI/UX</li>
	<li>Emerging technologies such as IoT and XR</li></ul>
	<li>Brand design</li>
	<li>Publication design</li>
	<li>Data visualisation</li>
	<li>Exhibitional artworks</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Her divergent practice demonstrates that the contemporary designer doesn’t have to exist within one category, but can investigate multiple design channels over the course of their career.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Who do your role model serve with their practice? What imaginaries are they reinforcing? What milieu are they contributing to with their work?</p>
<p>“The creator asked me: ‘Who do you think will buy your paintings?’ And I was like: ‘Maybe someone who’s awkward and lonely and vulnerable?’ And then she said: ‘Oh, you mean everybody.’” (Ye, 2019)</p>
<p>For Ye, the appeal of calligraphy and ink is its organic nature: it’s unpredictable to use. However, there is a dichotomy in her practice as her love for technology, especially coding which is rigid and precise, also shines through. As a result, Ye seeks to combine these two concepts when possible. In 2018 they were invited to assist in the development of p5.js, a creative coding library for Javascript, which culminated in the design of a homepage for the site. The interactive image mirrored the flow of ink on paper, but was created with under a hundred lines of code. In a 2019 Google Design Notes interview, Ye explains: “the story is more important than the medium itself.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ye’s work both as an artist and a designer seek to explore issues personal to her: a sense of awkwardness and vulnerability that they’ve lived with since their childhood, and shared with our society as technology starts playing a bigger role in our lives.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What values and ethics are reflected in their work?</p>
<p>Ye’s design practice is heavily influenced by her personal values, which at its core is a deep interest in people. In 2015, she made data visualisations for the purpose of education on police brutality and refugees. In 2017, through the design studio she founded called Y/ES, Ye created 100 different (often whimsical) rooms which served as a meta-commentary on architectural drawing and an investigation into social relations. Her work touches on issues of relationships, awkwardness, gender, politics, censorship and immigrants, through the lens of design for places, things and for its own sake. Their design work is exploratory, and as a result can cultivate meaning in different ways for each viewer.</p>
<p>A defining ethic of Ye’s practice is a focus on interactivity. Her 2018 project Algorithmic Censorship Toolkit is made up of various interactive web pages that seek to educate the public on China’s oppressive censorship tactics. Her work is often designed to be manipulated by the public: changed in such a way that each person can make their own conclusions about the subject, or become more cognizant of an issue.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What is their public visibility? How does their professional profile present across different outputs? How is their work represented across various media? Examine how this profile best represents their work.</p>
<p>Ye is the recipient of multiple design awards, namely for their work in creative media and community building. The latter was awarded as a result of Ye’s work on p5.js, which is “an open-source art and education platform that prioritizes access and diversity in learning to code, with over 1.5 million users.” (UCLA, 2022) This platform, founded by fellow LA-based artist and programmer Lauren Lee McCarthy, is now overseen by Ye.</p>
<p>Her personal work is categorised on her website, which ranges from digital products such as web pages and app designs to publications and physical exhibitions of artwork. In addition, a separate tab labelled ‘Experiments’ contains various digital toys, powered by creative coding. Ye effectively weaves her personal values and storytelling skills through a range of multidisciplinary outputs, demonstrating her talent for synthesising traditional and contemporary mediums into products that are accessible and engaging.</p>
